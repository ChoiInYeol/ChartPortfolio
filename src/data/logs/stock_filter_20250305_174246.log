2025-03-05 17:44:24,303 - StockDataProcessor - ERROR - Error in filter_stocks: time data "1994-04-05" doesn't match format "%Y%m%d", at position 0. You might want to try:
    - passing `format` if your strings have a consistent format;
    - passing `format='ISO8601'` if your strings are all ISO8601 but not necessarily in exactly the same format;
    - passing `format='mixed'`, and the format will be inferred for each element individually. You might want to use `dayfirst` alongside this.
